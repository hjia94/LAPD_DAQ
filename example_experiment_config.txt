description = Multi-scope Data Acquisition with Probe Movement
    Experiment: 18-isatswp-p39-xy-2000G-800G
    Date: 2024-12-XX
    Operator: Research Team

    LAPD B field:
    ========
    Black magnets at south:(PS12-13: 1100A)	2.0 kG
    Magenta & yellow magnets: 		0.8 kG
    Black magnet at north PS11: (0 A) 	0.0 kG

    South LaB6 source:
    ============
    He plasma, 120 V bank discharge voltage, 3282 A discharge current
    1/3 Hz rep rate 
    Heater: ~36Vrms/2050 A

    Timing:
    =====
    South Lab6 source: 0-15 ms 
    Lang Sweep: 200 us pulse-width, 18 cycles every 1 ms starting at 0.7 ms
    Scope trigger: load traces to see. Must be several milliseconds before plasma turned on

    Moving Lang probe, coated shaft, 4 tip on port 29 (drive 4)

    Probe Movement:
    - Controlled by motion control system
    - Parameters loaded from [position] section below when available

    50 Ohm termination on scope.
    Isat channel has a low pass filter to kill noise.
